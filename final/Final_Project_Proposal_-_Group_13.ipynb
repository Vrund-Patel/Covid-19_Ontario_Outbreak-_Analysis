    "2. Find from what date did the data collected started from\n",
    "3. How many outbreak groups are there\n",

We can use the data we currently have to prevent future outbreaks from happening. For example if there are more outbreaks happening in schools, we can restrict the access that students and teachers have to schools (make it online). \n"
